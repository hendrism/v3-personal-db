# Flask Session Tracking App - Implementation Log

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Project:** v3-personal-db Flask Session Tracking Application  
**Scope:** Complete overhaul of session management, UI improvements, and SOAP notes functionality

## Original Requirements

The user requested updates to their Flask-based session tracking app with the following changes and fixes:

### Session Creation & Types
- After creating a session, redirect to Dashboard or a page that allows adding more sessions (not directly to trial entry)
- Only allow Individual or Group as session types. Remove all other types.

### Session Status Tracking
- Add a status selector to the live trial tracking page, available for each student in a group session
- The selectable statuses should be:
  - Completed
  - Missed – No Makeup Required (this also counts as a completed session)
  - Missed – Makeup Required
  - Completed Makeup Session (with ability to link to a session that was missed previously)

### Time & Defaults
- Remove 24-hour time format everywhere (currently still showing on Trial Data Entry page)
- When linking data tracking to an existing session: Prefill session info (date, type, start/end time, session notes) from that session record. No defaults needed.
- For unlinked quick entry: Only provide these default options:
  - 30 min Individual
  - 30 min Group

### Data Tracking UI
- Redesign so users can more easily navigate between students and objectives without excessive scrolling
- On save, do not clear data. Instead:
  - Add an "End Session" button
  - This should save the session and redirect to a summary page where the user can review and adjust counts before finalizing

### Session Detail Page
- Currently shows all trial data lumped together across students/goals
- A complete redesign of this page to better fit the current system is acceptable
- The redesigned page must separate data by student and by objective for clarity

### SOAP Notes
- For percentages, only provide these calculation options:
  - Independent = (independent ÷ total trials)
  - Min Support = (independent + min support) ÷ total trials
  - Mod Support = (independent + min + mod) ÷ total trials
  - Max Support = (independent + min + mod + max) ÷ total trials
- Do not include raw counts (e.g., total trials, breakdown by support)
- Do not auto-fill the Objective box with trial data. Let the user decide what goes there.
- On save, show the full SOAP note in one editable text box for last-minute edits before confirming
- When viewing a saved SOAP note, show the full text only (not the editable form)
